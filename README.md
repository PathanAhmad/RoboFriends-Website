I developed a website using React, where users can browse a collection of robot profiles. The profiles include the robot's name, and can be sorted in real-time using the search box, without needing to navigate to a separate page. The website pulls data for the robots from an API, which is formatted in JSON.

To improve the user experience, I implemented a fixed scroll box that remains visible even when the user scrolls. This makes it easy to access the search box and sort the robot profiles at any time. Additionally, I optimized the website for speed and responsiveness, ensuring that it loads quickly and performs well on different devices.
